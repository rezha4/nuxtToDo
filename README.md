# Documentation
## Getting Started
This is my first time coding with Vue.js & Nuxt.js, but since it is a simple to do app & still falls beneath the javascript ecosystem, I am confident that I can do well.

## Installing Nuxt.js
I started this by browsing nuxtjs on google, and immediately bringed to Nuxt's home page, where I run npx nuxi@latest init <my-app>.
So I run it in my Ubuntu WSL2 terminal, entered a bunch of (y)'s, and voila the project is scaffolded, just like Next.js.

## Setting Up Postgres
Finding a hosted postgresql is a bit tricky because they're often not very generous with the limit, usually only 1 db per account.
I used neon for this project.
